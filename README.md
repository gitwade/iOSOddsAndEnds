Odds and ends that might be useful for iOS apps

UIViewController (IconInTitle) category:
 * UIViewController+IconInTitle.h
 * UIViewController+IconInTitle.m

	When using a UIViewController who's title appears in a Navigation Bar (like in UINavigation controller), 
	this is a handy category that will add an Icon to the front of the title.
	Just call the addIconToTitle method passing in the name of the icon.
